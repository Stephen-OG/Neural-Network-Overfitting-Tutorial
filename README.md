# Understanding Overfitting in Neural Networks (TensorFlow CNN)

This repository contains the code and tutorial for my machine learning assignment on
overfitting in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and how to reduce it using
Dropout, L2 weight decay and Early Stopping.

## Contents

- `Machine_Learning_Assignment.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook with all TensorFlow/Keras code used to train the models and generate the plots.

- `Understanding Overfitting in Neural Networks and Techniques to Prevent It.pdf`  
  PDF version of the tutorial (also submitted via CodeGrade).

- `figs/`  
  Saved figures used in the tutorial (baseline, dropout, L2, early stopping).

## How to run

1. Install Python 3 and the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
